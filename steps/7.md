# Request
order the filtered points of interest in the order they will be encountered by following the track

# Output
1. Understand the current implementation of how points of interest are fetched and displayed
2. Examine the OpenStreetMapService class to see how points of interest are currently filtered and sorted
3. Look at the implementation of `getPointsOfInterestForFeature` and `filterPointsOfInterestByDistanceToTrack` methods
4. Modify the code to order points of interest based on their position along the track
5. Test the changes to ensure they work as expected

# Summary
The points of interest were successfully modified to be ordered by their position along the track instead of by distance. The implementation is error-free, and the application ran successfully, confirming that the points are now displayed in the correct order.
