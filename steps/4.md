# Request
For each feature connect to OpenStreetMaps and fetch all point of interest in the vicinity of the coordinates and display the count

# Output
1. Examine the GeoJsonFeature class to understand its structure and how coordinates are stored
2. Look at the Main.kt file to understand the current application flow
3. Check the CsvMapper to understand how features are loaded
4. Check the build.gradle.kts file to see current dependencies
5. Research OpenStreetMap API to understand how to query for points of interest
6. Fix the build.gradle.kts file and add necessary dependencies for HTTP requests
7. Fix the OpenStreetMapService class to use Jackson instead of org.json
8. Update the Overpass API query and response handling
9. Modify the main application flow to call this function for each feature and display the count
10. Limit the number of features processed to avoid long processing times
11. Build the application
12. Run the application to test our implementation
