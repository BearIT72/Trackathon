# Request
Filter the points of interest closest to the track

# Output
1. Understand the current implementation by examining the relevant files
- Examine Main.kt to understand the current flow
- Check OpenStreetMapService.kt to see how points of interest are fetched
- Look at GeoJsonFeature.kt to understand the structure of features
- Review CsvMapper.kt to understand how data is loaded
2. Determine how to calculate distance between points and a track
3. Implement a filtering mechanism to select points of interest closest to the track
4. Update the main function to use this filtering mechanism
5. Test the implementation

# Summary
A filtering mechanism was implemented to retrieve points of interest closest to a track, utilizing distance calculations and sorting. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed successfully.
