# Request
Add h2 database to store:
- id
- input geojson
- filtered POIs

# Output
1. Explore the project structure to understand the codebase better
2. Check the build.gradle.kts file to see current dependencies
3. Examine the GeoJsonFeature.kt file to understand the data structure
4. Check the OpenStreetMapService.kt file to understand the points of interest structure
5. Add H2 database and necessary dependencies to build.gradle.kts
6. Create a database entity/model class to represent the stored data
7. Implement a database service/repository to handle database operations
8. Update Main.kt to use the database service
9. Test the changes to ensure they work as expected

# Summary
An H2 database was successfully integrated to store the id, input geojson, and filtered points of interest. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed, with the application successfully saving and retrieving data from the database.
