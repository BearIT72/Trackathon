# Request
when searching for points of interest use a bounding box enclosing the whole track

# Output
1. Understand the current implementation of OpenStreetMapService.kt
2. Examine the GeoJsonFeature class to understand its structure
3. Modify the OpenStreetMapService to:
   a. Create a new method to calculate a bounding box for the entire track/feature
   b. Update the Overpass API query to use the bounding box instead of a single point with radius
   c. Create a method to calculate the bounding box for a GeoJsonFeature
   d. Update the getPointsOfInterestCountForFeature method to use the new approach
4. Test the changes to ensure they work correctly
   a. Build the project
   b. Run the application
   c. Verify our implementation is correct by reviewing the code

# Change
Fetch actual nodes instead of summary

# Request
Map the results of the current OSM query

# Output
1. Understand the current implementation of OpenStreetMapService.kt
2. Examine how GeoJsonFeature.kt is structured
3. Check Main.kt to understand how the OSM service is currently being used
4. Look at the steps/5.md file to understand the requirements for this task
5. Examine the complete OpenStreetMapService.kt to understand its current implementation
6. Create a data class to represent a Point of Interest (POI)
7. Check if fetchPointsOfInterestInBoundingBox already returns a list of POIs
8. Update getPointsOfInterestCountForFeature to return POIs and rename it appropriately
9. Update Main.kt to handle and display the mapped results
10. Test the implementation
    a. Build the project
    b. Check if there's a discrepancy in the Main.kt file location
    c. Fix the package declaration in Main.kt
    d. Build the project again
    e. Run the application
11. Summarize the changes made and submit the solution
