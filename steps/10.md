# Request
Refine POIs filtering by discarding POIs that are close enough to be duplicates before applying the filter

# Output
1. Understand the current POI filtering implementation
- Identify where POIs are defined and stored
- Identify where POI filtering is currently implemented
2. Understand how POI proximity/duplication could be determined
- Look for existing distance calculation methods
- Determine what "close enough" means in this context
3. Examine the method that calls `filterPointsOfInterestByDistanceToTrack` to understand the full workflow
4. Implement a method to identify and discard duplicate POIs
5. Modify the existing filtering logic to first remove duplicates
6. Test the implementation to ensure it works correctly

# Summary
A method to remove duplicate POIs based on geographical proximity was implemented in the `OpenStreetMapService` class, enhancing the existing filtering logic. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed successfully.
