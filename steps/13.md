# Request
Display the original track as a continuous line in the UI

# Output
1. Examine the MapView.kt file to understand how tracks are currently displayed
2. Identify the code responsible for rendering track points
3. Analyze the TrackPainter class to see if it's correctly drawing continuous lines
4. Check the Track class in DatabaseService.kt to understand how track data is structured
5. Examine the GeoJsonFeature class to understand how track coordinates are structured
6. Verify how the track waypoints are created and used in the MapView
7. Identify any issues with how the track is being displayed
8. Check if there are any issues with the TrackPainter.paint method
9. Check if there are any issues with the createTrackWaypoints function
10. Check if there are any issues with how the MapView component is being used in the TrackathonApp
11. Modify the TrackPainter class to draw the track as a continuous line using a path instead of individual line segments
12. Test the changes to ensure the track is displayed correctly
13. Verify that other functionality (like POI display) still works correctly

# Summary
A modification was made to the `TrackPainter` class to draw the track as a continuous line using a `Path2D` object, ensuring a smooth appearance in the UI. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed.

# Request
Make the UI scrollable and the mapview zoomable

# Output
1. Examine the structure of TrackathonApp.kt to understand the current UI layout
2. Examine the structure of MapView.kt to understand how the map is currently implemented
3. Identify how to make the UI scrollable (likely using ScrollPane or similar component)
- Need to use Compose's ScrollableColumn or verticalScroll modifier
4. Identify how to make the MapView zoomable (likely adding zoom controls or mouse wheel zoom)
- Need to add mouse wheel listener to JXMapViewer
5. Implement the scrollable UI changes
- Added imports
- Added verticalScroll to track list Column
- Added verticalScroll to track details Column
6. Implement the zoomable MapView changes
- Added imports for mouse events
- Added mouse wheel listener for zooming
- Added mouse drag listener for panning
7. Test the changes to ensure they work as expected

# Summary
The UI was made scrollable by adding vertical scroll functionality to both the track list and track details sections. Additionally, the MapView was enhanced to be zoomable and pannable through mouse wheel and drag interactions. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed.
